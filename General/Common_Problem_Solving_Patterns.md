# Some Patterns seen in Problem Solving

## Broad classification of the various patterns

-   Frequency Counter
-   Multiple Pointers
-   Sliding Window
-   Divide and Conquer
-   Dynamic Programming
-   Greedy Algorithms
-   Backtracking

**See the various folders in the 'Problem Solving Patterns' directory to see examples of these patterns**

### Frequency Counter Pattern's Examples : We store the frequency of various items in an array into an object as key-value pairs.

#### 1) Write a function called Same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same

#### 2) Check if two strings are anagrams.

### Multiple Pointers' Examples : We start iterating through an array(for example), using multiple pointers (reference variables, not strictly pointers)

#### 1) Write a function which accepts a sorted array and returns the first pair whose sum results in zero.

#### 2) Write a function which accepts a sorted array and returns the number of unique values in that array

### Sliding Window: It's useful when we have an iterable entity like a String or an array, and we want a subsection that has some common property in some sense. Hence this is very useful when we have to keep track of any subarray of an array.

#### 1) Write a function that accepts an array and a number(num), which then returns the largest sum of _num_ consecutive elements of the array.
