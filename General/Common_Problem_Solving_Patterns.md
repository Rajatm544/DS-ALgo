# Some Patterns seen in Problem Solving

## Broad classification of the various patterns

-   Frequency Counter
-   Multiple Pointers
-   Sliding Window
-   Divide and Conquer
-   Dynamic Programming
-   Greedy Algorithms
-   Backtracking

**See the various folders in the 'Problem Solving Patterns' directory to see examples of these patterns**

### Frequency Counter Pattern's Examples : We store the frequency of various items in an array into an object as key-value pairs.

#### 1) Write a function called Same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same

#### 2) Check if two strings are anagrams.

### Multiple Pointers' Examples : We start iterating through an array(for example), using multiple pointers (reference variables, not strictly pointers)

#### 1) Write a function which accepts a sorted array and returns the first pair whose sum results in zero.

#### 2) Write a function which accepts a sorted array and returns the number of unique values in that array
