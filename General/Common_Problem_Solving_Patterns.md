**See the various folders in the 'Problem Solving Patterns' directory to see examples of these patterns**

### Frequency Counter Pattern's Examples

#### 1) Write a function called Same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same

#### 2) Check if two strings are anagrams.

### Multiple Pointers' Examples

#### 1)
