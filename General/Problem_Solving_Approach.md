# Problem Solving Strategies

## 5 milestones in solving a problem

1. Understand the problem thorououghly.
2. Explore some of the concrete exmples provided to gauge the given problem.
3. Break it down to simpler steps.
4. Solve/Simplify the smaller problems involved in the solution of the larger problem statement.
5. Look back and refactor the code to optimize, if possible.

### Understanding the probelm statement

-   Rephrase the problem in your own words to see if you actually understand what the problem is asking
-   Check what are the inputs needed, and what type of inputs are needed, and how many of them are needed
-   Check what is the expected output.
-   Check if the inputs provide enough data to actually solve the given problem.
-   Label the functions/variables if need be.

### Concrete Example

-   Come up with examples for correctly solving the problem. It may be trivial to begin, but also include complex examples and edge cases.
-   Edge cases are give a hint as to what not to do! Examples: no input, invalid input, edge cases of input constrants, and so on.
-   They can act as sanity checks at the end, to check whether our solution is able to solve the problem.

### Break it Down

-   Jolt down the steps you wish to take in order to solve the problem, probably as comments in the code. This can help the interviewer understand what our approach is going to be like.

### Solve/Simplify

-   Start by coding the comments' written down. If there is a difficulty to deal with, and the code for it seems to be out-of-sight, It's best bet to ignore it for a while and continue along with the rest of the problem to get a some % of the way there.
-   It's not always the case that the interviewer will be looking for the complete/correct solution to the probelem within the given timeframe, moreso the approach is what should be more accurate to what the problem is demainding from you.

### Look back and refactor

-   Once you have a working prototype, it's fine to ask the interviewer questions about what are the possible chances for optimizing the approach, what are some other approaches, what is the problem with my code, etc.
-   Refactor the code to weed out obvious performance flaws left out earlier in favour of prototyping a solution
