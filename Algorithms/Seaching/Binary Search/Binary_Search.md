# Binary Search

-   It is a faster seraching algoithm when compared to linear search, as it seraches for onlya fraction of the input array.
-   The algorithm uses the **Divide and Rule** pattern to solve the problem.
-   **NOTE**: This only works on a sorted array, as we need to make the decision to discard a section of the input by comparing the search element with the middle element of the subsection in question.
-   Time complexity of the binary serach algorithm is as follows:
    Average & Worst case is **O(log n)**, Best case is O(1).
